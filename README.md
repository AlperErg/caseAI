#### Requirements

- Python IDE to run the application.

#### How to use

1. Get an OpenAI API key. It is free to open an OpenAI account and gives you plenty of credits for a few months. [Here is how to create an API key, given you have an account.](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key)
2. Run the application on a Python IDE of your choice.
3. Input your OpenAI API key in the console.
4. Access the web interface via the local IP given in the console.
5. Press "Start Talking". You can now start talking with case by saying the call phrase **"Hey Case"** or **"Case"**.

#### Features

- You can call Case by any phrase including her name, like _**"What's up Case?"**_ or **_"Bonjour Case!"_**
- You can end talking while Case is waiting for you to call her name by saying **"stop"** or **"thank you"** in your phrase.
- Case will timeout if you don't talk to her, saving you many tokens. To start talking again, you only have to press the **Start Talking** button.
